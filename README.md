1. exercise
Write a program, that based on a positive integer ‘n’ number (could be a predefined variable as well) draws an X letter to the console using characters ‘/’ (forward slash) and ‘\’ (backslash), positioned with spaces. The stem length of the letter X is exactly n.
E.g.: if n = 4 (dots represent spaces in the diagram, they help count the spaces):

Note: In Java writing/printing a “\” character to the console can be achieved by using “\\” (String) or ‘\\’ (char)!



2. exercise
Write to the console all three digit numbers that remain the same when their digits are reversed.
For example 121, 343. 143 is not.

2b. exercise
Write an algorithm for the previous exercise that DOES NOT use Strings and concatenation, only integer arithmetic operations (Java operators). So iterate through all three digit numbers and write to the console the same numbers. For example 121, 343, 464 etc.

3. Exercises
Generate two point in a 2D coordinate system and determine the distance between them. Print to the console the coordinates and the distance. The coordinates are integers. 
Eg.:

Point1: x:2, y:5
Point2: x:7: y:3
Distance: 5.3852
